# QuickSW
Add a service worker and offline page with a single JS file

The code in this repository works out of the box

# To customize your own: 
All you need to add is modify the "offline/index.html" file, and optional "offline/script.js" and "offline/style.css" files

You can use QuickSW in your website with:
`<script src="QuickSW.js"></script>`

Both of these are done in the example, so it may be wise just to build off of the example.
